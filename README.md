Local grocery price comparison




Solution 
The program, PricePatrol, outputs a map based on an entered address in Toronto, which shows local grocery stores and their prices for an item. 

The map calculates an average price of these groceries and highlights which stores sell at a below average, average, and above average price.



Program instructions
PricePatrol is a website that first asks the user to create an account. After, it asks for an address in Toronto before showing a map there, then it asks the user to pick two things from a drop-down menu; a grocery item to compare prices for and a number of local grocery stores to compare from. The grocery stores then pop up on the map with their item price, and the user should pick the lowest to shop from. 

Some extra details are that there’s a side menu that displays the cheapest and most expensive prices for an item, PricePatrol can redirect to Google Maps to get directions to a store, and it saves stores that the user visited. Displaying the cheapest and most expensive prices gives Canadians a better sense of pricing for groceries, showing how low and high prices can get relative to the average. Seeing the difference, this shows the users the practicality of checking prices. Redirecting users to Google Maps helps them get to stores and see travel times, making their shopping experience easier and schedule their trips. Meanwhile, storing user data allows personalization



Tech choices
AI helped in the coding process, while the code was shared and written on Codesandbox. Generative AI tools help the team write in unfamiliar languages and combine code between team members. Since HTML is a popular front-end language, we used it to write the project.


Impact
PricePatrol helps Canadians find the lowest grocery prices to make informed shopping decisions. With notable inflation on everyday items, this especially helps the working class make less forced expenses so they can save money and live more comfortably.



Assumptions
PricePatrol currently does not use real grocery prices from real grocery stores, only using prices from the team’s sense of pricing. This assumes there’s a notable difference in pricing between stores that is worth checking, while real grocery stores might not actually be so conveniently close to the user.
